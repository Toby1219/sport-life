The very name of this product should be warning enough that you’re heading into deeper waters.\n What is the meaning of 5150?\n Rich Piana originally went with the name “5150” for this ultra-high stimulant pre-workout because he wanted to convey that this pre-workout was not for the ordinary, but for only the serious stim junkies among us. And while Rich wasn’t insinuating that taking a few scoops of 5150 pre-workout would result in a 72-hour “involuntary psychiatric hold”, he wanted to convey that this product meant business!\n Have you grown bored of other pre-workouts, having ‘tried them all’ before getting this point? Do the results you seek lay beyond the normal conditions of training? Do you need to focus and energize your workout while hydrating your muscles and keeping your body anabolic? If yes, then you may have met the qualifications to start training like a true 5%ER; to enter the territory where only a few thrive: mass monster territory. If you routinely seek the pain of a long training session and routinely need to be spotted by at least two smaller freaks of the gym, then we’d like to welcome you to 5150 Legendary Series High-Stim Pre-Workout."

The body has to transition from its preferred energy source, glucose, to ketones such as BHB (Beta-Hydroxybutyrate). The process is less than enjoyable and can often take several days. The process can be much easier on your body with the use of exogenous ketones which increase levels of ketones in the blood thereby replacing glucose as the body’s main energy source. This allows experiencing all the benefits of the Ketogenic Diet including fat loss, improved focus, more energy, and improved performance. Additionally, exogenous ketones work great if you’re already following a keto-based dietary plan and need to get back into a state of ketosis. As your body shifts into ketosis, glucose will soon become unavailable and your body will transition to the use of ketone bodies, such as BHB Salts, for the production of energy. However, the process of changing over your energy source can take DAYS and often be quite unenjoyable, producing what is known commonly as the “keto flu”. That’s where BHB Salts come to the rescue and can help you reach the state of ketosis, faster."

        "Discription":"When it came to protein powders Rich Piana was adamant about one thing – he didn’t like them. Rich downright hated everything about them! Instead, he believed in the idea of whole food complete meals and that kind of thinking guided him in his quest to create exceptional supplements that offered more. When the time came for 5% to create a premium product, high in available protein, we knew that we had to stay true to his primary beliefs. Anything that 5% Nutrition created had to be a complete whole food meal. We didn’t merely create a protein powder or just another meal replacement powder – that would have been too easy. We did it the 5% way by creating a complete whole food meal, Real Carbs + Protein! We’re talking about 20 grams of whole food proteins combined with 30 grams of whole food carbohydrates. The perfect bodybuilding meal. Talk about the ultimate meal replacement! A true bodybuilding protein blend must be able to keep you in an anabolic environment to support lean muscle growth, and that’s exactly what we did with Real Carbs + Protein.(1) Protein has been sourced from an innovative complex: HyrdoBEEF Hydrolyzed Beef Protein, Whole Egg Powder, Chickpea Protein, and Organic Chicken Powder. This combination creates a protein blend with variable digestion speeds that’s extremely high in quality, purity, nitrogen retention, and bioavailability."

Yet Rich knew the week leading up to contest day would determine where he would ultimately place. Rich understood the importance of shedding excess water weight before a competition. To do this, he would use a special combination of Dandelion Root, Shavegrass, and Uva Ursi Extract. These powerful ingredients were the key to making sure Rich was ripped to the bone and ready to storm the stage. When we set out to create the kind of hardcore diuretic Rich would be proud of, we took a good look at all the possible ingredient options. Of course, we only chose the most effective and safest ingredients available. Included in this powerful formula is 600mg of Dandelion Extract, 550mg of Shavegrass, and 450mg of Uva Ursi Extract, and that’s just the beginning. There’s much more in our heavy-hitting Stage Ready formula to help you rapidly shed excess water weight.

You are closing in on muscle failure with each rep and every set you pump out. You are not the type who is merely \"working out,\" but you're straight up getting after it; you maintain a desire to reach the pinnacle of both size and strength. When achieving success in the gym, your body’s natural hormones play a major role in the final output. Testosterone is the king of hormones your body produces for muscle size and strength. Nothing beats testosterone when talking about increasing your body’s production of muscle-building power. It provides several positive functions in the body. These include key roles in promoting muscle growth, enhancing strength, and improving stamina in the gym. You’ll find it also improves your stamina in the bedroom. To achieve optimal size and strength naturally, you must maximize your body’s production of the hormone testosterone. You also need a healthy mindset that goes along with this approach. With Test from 5% Nutrition, we're helping you push yourself toward your optimal physique and muscle-building goals, as well as your mental toughness to help you transform yourself from the inside out. That sounds great, but there’s a problem: as men age, their natural testosterone level begins to decline. The decline starts much earlier than in men in their 30s or even 40s; natural production begins to decline as early as your mid-20s! Yes, you read that right, and that’s not an easy problem to solve unless you use a natural test booster."
